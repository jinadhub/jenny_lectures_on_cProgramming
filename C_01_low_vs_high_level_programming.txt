- Programs must be converted into machine code before it can be executed by the computer 
- Low level languages
	-there are two languages 
		- machine language: machine oriented, close to the hardware, hence you need to strong knowledge of the sytem architecture. Architectures of CPU are different. It is computer architecture dependent.  
		- assembly language: In this language we can use symbols 
			e.g add for +; sub for - assembly language are more readable to humans. 
			- the assembler compile the code into machine code before execution, slower than machine language 

- High level language:
	- Not machine dependent but are sometimes OS dependent. 
	- Close to human than the machine, more understandable to humans 
	- must be converted into machine code
	- the conversion to done by the compiler or the interpreter 
	- It is slower due to the conversion into machine code
